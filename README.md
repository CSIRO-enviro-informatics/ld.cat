## Introduction to Loc-I

Location Index (Loc-I) is a framework that provides a consistent way to seamlessly integrate data on people, business, and the environment.

Location Index aims to extend the characteristics of the foundation spatial data of taking geospatial data (multiple geographies) which is essential to support public safety and wellbeing, or critical for a national or government decision making that contributes significantly to economic, social and environmental sustainability and linking it with observational data. Through providing the infrastructure to support cross-domain foundation data linkages and analysis will open up substantial opportunity for providing a richer set of information to develop, analyse and evaluate policy, programs and service delivery by government.

Refer to the locationindex.org site for more info.

Location Index is part of the Data Integration Partnership for Australia (DIPA) program which utilises the collective resources of Geoscience Australia, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIRO), the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and the Department of the Environment and Energy.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by all partners to define specific contributions to the Location Index for both resource and intellectual property contributions. It also defines partners º roles such as business ownership, project management, technical development and advisors.
