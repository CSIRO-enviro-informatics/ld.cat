# LocI Cat
The LocI project's Linked Data asset catalogue.

This is a web-based catalogue listing the Datasets, Linksets, ontologies and tools generated by the [LocI Project](http://loci.cat). It only contains information extracted from the items that make up its holdings so it acts only as a convenient cache for item discovery.

The catalogue periodically harvests Datasets, Linksets, ontologies and tools metadata from their points-of-truth and stores that information locally to then be rendered as called by people or machine using the catalogue.


## Catalogue Implementation
### Harvester
The harvesting component of this catalogue uses a series of very simple [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) scripts to collect Datasets, Linksets, ontologies and tools metadata from their points of truth. It is able to do this very simple since all of those items present basic [DCAT (revised)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) metadata at easy-to-find web addresses and using the [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) data format. 

For example, the [GNAF Dataset](http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf) is online at the persistent URI of [http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf) and its DCAT (rev.) metadata is accessible by adding the Query Strong Arguments *_view* and *_format* to that URI: <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf?_view=dcat&format=text/turtle">http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf<strong>?_view=dcat&format=text/turtle</strong></a>.

The harvester uses Python's [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module to retrieve all item's DCAT (rev.) RDF and then it stores it in a Python [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data graph. It then applies some rule-based reasoning to that graph using the [OWL-RL](https://owl-rl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Web Ontology Language ([OWL](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL)) rule engine to create generic generic properties from the items' specialised ones.

The harvester validates each item's RDF data by using the [pySHACL](https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/), [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) to comparing the information it retries to 'shapes' templates of expected information.  

When done, the harvester stores the items' validated information in a single on-disk graph that it can use to service catalogue requests for information (see next section).

### Web catalogue
This catalogue uses a very simple Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) HTTP framework instance to service requests for the information it contains. In general, it receives a request (someone or some tool clicking on a web link at `http://loci.cat/...`) and translates that into a Python function call that accesses the information the catalogue contains. Since the catalogue stores all of its information within an RDF data graph, it uses either [rdflib loop queries](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro_to_graphs.html) or [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) queries facilitated by rdflib.
