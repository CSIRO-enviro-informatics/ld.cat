# Loc-I Explorer

Test site:
[http://loci-integration-app-test.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com](http://loci-integration-app-test.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com)

## What

A visual explorer that interfaces with the [Loc-I reference cache](ref-cache.md) APIs. This tool will enable users to visualise and interactively explore (by clicking on links) and searching the graph of interconnected ontologies (concepts), Loc-I datasets, spatial features within them and linksets that describe spatial relationships between them (i.e. by location, text labels, codes). 
     
## Why

The Loc-I integrated graph i.e. the datasets, spatial features within them, and links between them and to observation data stores that they reference, is a complex interconnected information space with billions of nodes and links between them. The Loc-I explorer provides user interfaces to enable to navigating of the graph. 
     
## How 

Via a web application that provides enable users to conduct point and click browsing and search across the graph. 

     
## MVP 
A web accessible interactive graph viewing tool that will enable users to search, find by point, and click to explore the [Loc-I reference cache](ref-cache.md) at the top level i.e. dataset and linkset level.
     
## Anticipated future functionality

* Improved graph visualisation 
* Improved graph filteringâ€“ e.g. filter by type of link, by location, by time 
* Improved search and filtering of Loc-I features
